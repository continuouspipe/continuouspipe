**listens to your code repository changes**, **builds your Docker images** and **deploy them to your Kubernetes cluster(s)**.

## Usage

- [Check out the website](https://continuouspipe.github.io) or [read the documentation](https://documentation-continuouspipe.github.io) to know more.

## Contributing

ContinuousPipe is Open Source. You are warmly welcome to contribute, we want you! You can install ContinuousPipe on your
development environment [with DockerCompose](INSTALL.md#option-1-docker-compose) and start working on the source code but
keep in mind that helping with the documentation and/or supporting others is as much valuable ðŸ’–
